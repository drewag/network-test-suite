Needed Short-term Changes
============================
- Don't freeze when variables are not parsed because of failed expectations
- Make sure asynchronous test suites work

Long Term Ideas
======================
- Use parsed responses in expectations
- Allow focusing specific tests
- Easily rerun only the next failed test. This could be used to fix each error, one at a time.
